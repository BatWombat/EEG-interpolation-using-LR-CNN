# Research-Workshop
## About :

Our regression models are trained on this waveform estimation (rERP) analysis detailed in:

https://github.com/caurnhammer/PLOSONE21lmerERP

And are tested on the dataset described in this Paper:

[Delogu, F., Brouwer, H., and Crocker, M. W. (2019). Event-related potentials index lexical retrieval (N400) and integration (P600) during language comprehension. *Brain and Cognition, 135*. doi: 10.1016/j.bandc.2019.05.007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262618304299)
